# Hello Everyone! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to FireTail's organization on GitHub. FireTail enables you to solve all the most critical problems facing APIs today with a hybrid approach, bringing together cloud, application and code with full blocking capabilities to solve the root causes of API data breaches - flaws at the application and business logic layer in authentication, authorization and data handling.

## FireTail Code Libraries

These repositories contain code libraries for Python, Golang, Node.js, and Ruby applications with the open source FireTail code library. Include the FireTail library with your APIs with minimal effort - less than 20 lines of code. We will then ingest the API specification and implement runtime controls, ensuring that only good API calls - those using expected, valid authentication types, destined for proper endpoints, and with properly formatted request parameters - are allowed.
The FireTail library is intended to be used as middleware. The library sits in line in the application and provides you with a centralized application layer security. Instantly benefit from API call inspection, protection against malicious calls, and centralized logging.

## FireTail SaaS Platform

Using FireTail's SaaS platform and incorporating our code libraries into your system offers a range of advantages. Some of our features include:

* <b>API Alerting & Monitoring</b>: With FireTail's cutting-edge API Alerting & Monitoring capabilities, you can safeguard your APIs and stay one step ahead of potential threats. Ensure the security of your APIs by defining triggers and monitoring critical metrics with real-time notifications.

* <b>API Security Posture Management</b>: Gain complete visibility into your APIs, identify breaches, and detect suspicious activity in real-time with advanced logging and event management. With FireTail you can identify potential misconfigurations, eliminate insecure versions, and ensure the robustness of your API ecosystem.

* <b>API Audit Trail</b>: With FireTail's API Audit Trail, consolidate all API events into a centralized logging system. Evaluate your OpenAPI Spec files showing you all of your allowed routes, methods, and paths. Anything off-spec gets caught and blocked. Monitor all of your API traffic in one place. Logs are monitored for attack patterns and trigger events and alerts to your key security operations tools.
Whether your APIs are hosted on-prem or in the cloud, our platform brings together the logs to provide a unified view and invaluable security insights. 

* <b> API Inventory</b>: With FireTail's API Inventory, you can maintain visibility and control over your APIs, prevent security breaches and unauthorized access attempts. FireTail offers advanced logging and event management capabilities, which allow organizations to monitor API activity and detect any suspicious behavior in real-time. From Library deployments to API Gateways and other integrations, our platform provides a unified view of all your APIs in a single, intuitive interface
